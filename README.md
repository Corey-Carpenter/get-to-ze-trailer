# Get To Ze Trailer

## Description
The goal for this project is for a user to search a movie title and then would display a poster and trailer of that movie along with director, genre, main actors/actresses, writers, ratings, year released, plot, etc. 

This project included a collective use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using one framework and two APIs. Our motivation is for users to have a "one stop shop" of information for movies they would want to know more about without looking endlessly through different links and searches. 

## Technology Used
CSS Framework: 
- [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/documentation/)

APIs:
- [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
- [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube)

## Usage
1. User would insert title of movie they would want to search
2. Press [Enter] Button
